# Guess the Number Game
A simple Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 1000, and the player tries to guess it.

### How It Works
1. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 1000.
2. The player inputs their guess.
3. The game will give hints whether the guess is too high or too low.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
5. The number of attempts is displayed when the correct guess is made.

### Example Output
